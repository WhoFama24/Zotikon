"""DavisWadeTestFile.py

    This file creates test cases for seeing how well the SYNAPSE RF200 devices can communicate with each other.
    A run of this program will test the connections by making a random() call to each device. This makes the
    device return a random number. This is merely to test the connection and pass data back and forth.

    This test will create a log file called LogFile.txt and will append to it. It records the data in this format

            THIS IS A X TEST CASE

            Test Case X:    description goes here
