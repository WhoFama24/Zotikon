"""HeartRateAndTempReadRF200.py

    This file is used to gathering heart rate and temperature on the synapse RF200 devices. In order to set this up
    you should do the following:

    Basic set up:
        make sure that you have your circuits and pieces powered by the same ground and power on the breadboard.

    Temperature:
        Hook up the ds1631 on a bread board. Hook up A0, A1, and A2 to ground for a 000 I2C address. Connect the SDA
        pin to GPIO 17 on the breakout board. connect the SCL pin to GPIO 18 on the breakout board.

        see more at https://developer.synapse-wireless.com/modules/rf200/port-mapping.html#i2c

        You can run ds1631_temp_read or get_data_string() on portal to see this output.


    Heart rate:
        For now all the heart rate function does is read the ADC pin and give a value between 0 and 1023. This is a
        10 bit ADC and has an internal VREF of 1.6 volts. In order to get a valid reading make sure you are using the
        same ground from the volatge you are reading. Hook up the GPIO 11 pin on the breakout board to the voltage
        source you want to read.

        You can run ds1631_temp_read or get_data_string() on portal to see this output.
