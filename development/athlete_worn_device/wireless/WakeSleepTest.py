"""TrainerStation.py
    This file is used to connect to the usb snapstick in order to collect data from the athlete worn devices. This
    function schedules a poll for each device that receives its heart rate and temperature. This program will buffer
    in responses for the WAIT_FOR_INITIAL_BUFFER_SECONDS. It polls devices every DEVICE_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS_SECONDS.
    Lastly, it will write to the data base for each device after we wait for the buffer to fill every
    DATABASE_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS_SECONDS.
    Make sure that the snapstick is not connected to portal or has any program loaded on it. This may cause us to not
    be able to connect to the snapstick."""
